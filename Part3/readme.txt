Part 3: Animation in Two Dimensions

There are four deliverables for Part 3 of the project, each
found in its own folder. They can be found and viewed in the
following manner:

	1.) Code:
		The source code is written in java and can be found in 
		'Part3\Code', which contains both the source .java files
		and the compiled .class files. The project can be run by
		running the 'java Frame' command while in 'Part3\Code'.

	2.) Data:
		This is the data for the position of all of the points
		being drawn on the screen and can be found in 'Part3\Data'
		There is a different file for each frame, and within that
		file there is the position data for each of the 3 models
		(L, O and T, respectively) split up into the position data
		for each triangle (which each consist of three points).

	3.) Frames:
		These are the frames that make up the animation the code
		generates, as well as the movie seen below, and can be
		found in 'Part3\Images'
		
	4.) Movie:
		The movie is an MP4 video, and is found in the 'Part3\Movie'
		folder.
